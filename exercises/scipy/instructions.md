# Scipy exercise

## Load data

Load the data from the file `data.txt`. It has 3 columns: `x`, `linear data` and `exponential data`.

Plot the data to see what it looks like.

## Fit data

Use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to fit a linear model to the linear data and an exponential model to the exponential data.

Modify your plot to add the two fitted models.

## Find intersection

Use `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` to find the intersection of the fitted curves.

Highlight the intersection on your plot.
